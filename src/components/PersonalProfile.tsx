                I am a front-end developer with a love for traveling the world. My adventures are not just about seeing new places;
                they also shape the way I approach web development. Being deaf gives me a unique perspective on inclusivity,
                ensuring everyone can use and enjoy the websites I create, a principle I stand by in all aspects of life.
