                Hello, digital adventurers and fellow developers! I am Luis, a seasoned front developer and avid explorer both in the world of code and the mystical lands of
                Old School RuneScape. My journey started in the lush lands of Fort Lauderdale, where I honed my skills as a Documentation Analyst before setting forth as a
                Front-End Developer, continually leveling up to a proficient Full Stack Developer.
            </p>
            <p>
                My experiences mirror an ever-engaging game of Old School RuneScape, filled with exciting quests, learning new skills, and constantly striving to improve and innovate.
                Being deaf has imbued me with a unique insight, fostering a commitment to inclusivity and accessibility in the digital landscapes I craft. Join me as we forge
                pathways of innovation and inclusivity in the vast expanses of the web!
