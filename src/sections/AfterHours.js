        <h2>Outside of Work</h2>
        <p>
            Whenever I am not working, I try to spend as much time outside as possible. During the summer, 
            I love to cruise, and in the winter, I love to be adventurous. When I get the chance, I make 
            every effort to travel, both domestically and overseas. 
        </p>
