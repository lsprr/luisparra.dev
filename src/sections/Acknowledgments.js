        <h2>Acknowledgments</h2>
        <p>
            A big thanks goes out to my family, friends, and mentors for their invaluable support and 
            diverse ideas that have been crucial to my journey. Together, we are making technology more 
            empowering and connected. The animation of the Capybara is taken from Old School Runescape, and its copyright is held by Jagex Ltd.
