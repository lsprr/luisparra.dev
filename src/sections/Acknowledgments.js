        <h2>Acknowledgments</h2>
        <p>
            A big thanks goes out to my family, friends, and mentors for their invaluable support and 
            diverse ideas that have been crucial to my journey. Together, we are making technology more 
            empowering and connected. A special thank you also goes out to the talented illustrator at 
            Humanities Studio enriching my journey even further.
