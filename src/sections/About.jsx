		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>
			I am a software engineer now based in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Lauderdale,_Florida" target="_blank" rel=”noopener noreferrer">Fort Lauderdale, Florida</a>. 
			I specialize in creating and ensuring accessibility for full-stack applications. When I am not 
			working, I enjoy playing Old School Runescape with my best friends and traveling around the world 
			to see areas I have never seen before.
