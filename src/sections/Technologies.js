                    I have used TypeScript for years and enjoy its static typing and versatility in creating

                    For years, I have used axe (accessibility testing tools) in my workflow, leveraging its 
                    tremendous capabilities to ensure web apps are accessible. It remains my preferred method 
                    for improving accessibility and providing inclusive user experiences.
