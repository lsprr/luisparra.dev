        <h2>My Work</h2>
        <p>
            I am now studying a Computer Science degree at <a href="https://www.wgu.edu/" target="_blank" rel=”noopener noreferrer">Western Governor University</a>
            and expect to graduate soon. Since 2016, I have been working as a software engineer, specializing 
            in frontend and backend development, as well as DevOps. My major goal is to ensure that any 
            full-stack projects to which I contribute promote accessibility and inclusion for all users.
